                </p>

                <h3>10.3 Effect of Termination</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon termination, all licenses granted to you under these Terms will immediately terminate.
                    Sections that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including but not

                    We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of significant
                    changes by updating the "Last Updated" date and, where appropriate, providing additional notice
                    within the App. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance
                    of the new Terms.
                </p>

                <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction
                    in which Clientist operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes

                <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
                    shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall
                    otherwise remain in full force and effect.
                </p>

                <h2>14. Entire Agreement</h2>

                <p>
                    The failure of Clientist to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
